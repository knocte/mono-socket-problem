This is an extract of real code that quite reliably shows the observed problem.  However, whether you will be able to observe the problem depends 
primarily on your hardware.  It typically takes no more than a minute or two to see the problem, but sometimes it runs smoothly event up to 30 minutes.  

You should watch for messages like the following one. 

# 127.0.0.1:2100 10613ms since last send started. No completion callback received, but socket status is READY_FOR_SEND. In send: 22

Sometimes it appears once and then goes away.  This case is bad as the callback is delayed for more than 5 seconds without any reason.  (We control 
CPU and network load). But more serious problem is that sometimes missed callback does not arrive at all.  This message is repeated multiple times in this case.

You definitely can find out all the details in the code, but in a few words we are looking for a sockets with SendAsync issued more than a second ago, such 
that we have not received a callback yet, but Socket.poll reports ready for send.
